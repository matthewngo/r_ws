3.2.1
See images.

3.2.2
See rollout_fudged. We used 21 constant controls in our kinematic model, evenly spaced between the minimum and maximum angles allowed, with a constant speed.

3.2.3
It runs at 30hz. 

3.2.4
Each template executes a single control for the entire template. We just set a constant speed and iterated through applicable angles.
