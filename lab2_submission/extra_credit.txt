1: For line following, we set the robot to back up if it loses the line until it sees it again as a countermeasure for missing a turn or losing the line in general.

For template matching, the robot will simply continue with the last control specified when it loses the line until it picks the line back up again.

2: To pick up the path with only grayscale, we follow this procedure:
	i.  blur the input grayscale with a gaussian blur filter.
	ii. apply canny edge detection to search for edges within the frame.
	iii.use Hough line detection to try and pick up lines within the canny filtered frame

After we find these lines, the line follower is implemented normally, using the lines generated by hough to find an ROI and follow it.
