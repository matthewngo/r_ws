precompute cv2 image for each template (in init):
make a cv2 image from projected rollout png (also precomputed)
make a mask from that (cv2.inRange)
crop rollout mask

each time you recompute your control:
bitwise_and each rollout mask with the cropped masked camera image -> template_compare
select template with max len(np.nonzero(template_compare))
execute control associated with template
