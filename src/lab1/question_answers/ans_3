1. We would incorporate additional sensors into our sensor model by adding additional steps to our sensor model. That is, we would use the posterior obtained by running our base sensor model and then incorporate this as the prior probability for future sensor, further updating our weights with more sensor data and thus improving our belief distribution. For example, if we were to incorporate IMU readings, we would use the data from the observed orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration and improve the accuracy of our particle weights.

2. If we were to localize the robot, we would add a GPS and a compass to help determine global location. These senors would be beneificial in determining the robot's current global position and heading. For a robotic hand, we would have additional touch sensors that would aid the robot in determining its location when in contact with an object of a known location.
