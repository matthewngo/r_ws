2.5

1. The kinematic motion model seemed to do better. It tracks the rotation more accurately, while the odometry model tracked the position change more accurately.

2. The kinematic motion model doesn't have a notion of acceleration or maintained velocity--they just get squished down to position. If it kept track in change of velocity, it would be able to more easily generate likely particles with a certain acceleration or deceleration.
The odometry motion model has a LOT of drift accumulation. I don't know a good way to fix that other than adding additional sensors like an IMU.
