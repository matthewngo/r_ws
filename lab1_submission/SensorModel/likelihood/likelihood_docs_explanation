The heatmaps show the likelihood map for each bag file. The associated csv files have a 3200 by 3200 grid (each cell representing the pixel at that xy position in the image) representing the angle (in radians) that gives the maximum weight associated with that pixel.

ParticleResolutionVsProcessingTime gives the processing time for generating the heatmap for differing discretization spacing between particles (i.e. spacing of 1 means the particles are right next to each other. spacing of 5 means that each particle is 5 pixels apart in both x and y). Every 10 degrees is used as the angle discretization and each run uses LaserScan1.bag.
